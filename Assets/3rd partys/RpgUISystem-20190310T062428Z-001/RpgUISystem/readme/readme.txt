Hi!
RpgUISystem is a customizable, mobile-friendly game UI pack 
containing elements that can be used to create a complete game with a nice look. 

- Every big button on click calls corresponding DialogInit class. 
- Every corresponding DialogInit class is overrided Dialog class with appropriate variables for this dialog.
- Dialog.Open() calls animation, when animation completed it calls via AnimationEvent Dialog.OpenComplete. Same is for Dialog.Close().

Sample characters are available at the Asset Store.
